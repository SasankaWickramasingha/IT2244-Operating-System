# Bash Nested Loops Exercises

This repository contains a Bash script (`Exercise.sh`) showcasing examples of nested loops in Bash. These examples help illustrate how loop structures can be used to print patterns, commonly used in programming exercises.

## Contents

The script demonstrates the following:

1. **Repeated Number Triangle**
   ```
   1
   2   2
   3   3   3
   4   4   4   4
   5   5   5   5   5
   6   6   6   6   6   6
   ```

2. **Increasing Sequence Triangle**
   ```
   1
   1   2
   1   2   3
   1   2   3   4
   1   2   3   4   5
   1   2   3   4   5   6
   ```

3. **Right-Aligned Pyramid of Asterisks**
   ```
         *
        * *
       * * *
      * * * *
     * * * * *
    * * * * * *
   * * * * * * *
   ```

## Usage

1. Make the file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Exercise.sh
   ```

2. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./Exercise.sh
   ```

## Requirements

- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

## Author

Generated as a sample script for practicing nested loops in Bash.
