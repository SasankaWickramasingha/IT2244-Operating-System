# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains a set of beginner-level C programming exercises. Each section demonstrates fundamental concepts such as printing output, user input, data types, variable assignment, and arithmetic operations.

## Files and Descriptions

### 01.c - Hello World
A basic program that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

### 02.c - Integer Output
Demonstrates variable declaration and printing an integer value using `printf()`.

### 03.c - Variable Assignment
Shows how one integer variable can be assigned to another.

### 04.c - Data Types and Sizes
Explores various data types: `int`, `double`, `float`, `char`, and how to use `sizeof()` to determine their size.

### 05.c - Single User Input
Takes user input for `int`, `double`, and `char` types using `scanf()`.

### 06.c - Multiple User Input
Accepts multiple inputs (a `double` and a `char`) in a single line.

### 07.c - Simple Calculator
Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.

## Usage

### Compiling a File

Use the following command in a terminal to compile any of the `.c` files:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
```

Replace `filename` with the desired source file name (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.).

### Running the Program

After compilation, run the program with:

```bash
./filename
```

For example:

```bash
gcc 07.c -o calc
./calc
```

## Notes

- `%d` or `%i` – for integers  
- `%f` – for floating-point numbers  
- `%lf` – for double-precision floating-point numbers  
- `%c` – for characters  
- `%s` – for strings

## Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- Terminal or command line interface
- Basic knowledge of the C programming language
