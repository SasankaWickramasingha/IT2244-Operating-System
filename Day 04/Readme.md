## Script Breakdown Program1
Prompt for User Name:

The script asks the user "Who are you?" and stores the user's input in the name variable.

Prompt for Numbers:

It asks the user to enter three numbers (x, y, z), one by one.

Calculate the Sum:

The sum of the three numbers is calculated using the formula sum=$(($x + $y + $z)).

Calculate the Average:

The average of the three numbers is calculated using avg=$((sum/3)).

Display the Results:

The script greets the user with their name and then displays the sum and average of the three numbers.

## Output Example

```
....Program1....
Who are you?
Malindu
Enter Number 1
10
Enter Number 2
15

Average: 16
```

## Script Breakdown Program2
Prompt for User Input:

The script asks the user to input two numbers: x and y.

Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: The sum of x and y is calculated using addition=$(($x + $y)).

Subtraction: The difference between x and y is calculated using substraction=$(($x - $y)).

Multiplication: The product of x and y is calculated using multiplication=$(($x * $y)).

Division: The quotient of x divided by y is calculated using division=$(($x / $y)).

Display Results:

The script then displays the results of the arithmetic operations, including the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
